# Early Access Survival Scam MMO

Welcome to "Early Access Survivals Scam MMO" – a game born out of a mix of frustration and a hefty dose of sarcasm. I'm not a professional programmer; in fact, I possess the most basic knowledge of Python.

This game is my small, sarcastic contribution to the gaming world. It's meant to bring a smile to your face and a tear of realization about the current practices in the gaming industry. So, don't take it too seriously – but enjoy playing this little jab at the Early Access culture!

## Final Note
Putting jokes aside, I have a deep love for computer and video games, having been a passionate gamer for over 40 years. This playful project is my sarcastic response to the state of some Early Access titles. It is dedicated to a friend I have known for over 20 years, whom I met while playing Battlefield 1942 and RTCW online. I value and appreciate him both as a fellow gamer and as a person (greetings to Mike). I don't need eye candy or the latest graphics; what I truly value is a solid game concept. Early Access can be a beneficial and effective approach. However, when a developer starts a Kickstarter campaign a decade ago, successfully raises funds, and sells Alpha and Beta access for up to €750 or more without delivering a game that offers more than the "Early Access Survival Scam MMO," it's understandable why some players feel frustrated. We can only hope for a change in direction. "Good things take time," and I agree with this saying. Yet, as customers and investors in an idea, we have the right to expect a certain level of progress. But really, don't take this rant too seriously. :)
